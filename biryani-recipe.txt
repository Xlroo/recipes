Ingredients:
For the Rice:
2 cups Basmati rice
4 cups water
2-3 cloves
2-3 green cardamom pods
1-inch cinnamon stick
1 bay leaf
1 teaspoon salt
For the Chicken Marinade:
500 grams chicken (cut into pieces)
1 cup yogurt
1 tablespoon ginger paste
1 tablespoon garlic paste
1 teaspoon red chili powder
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon garam masala powder
Salt to taste
For the Biryani:
2 large onions, thinly sliced
2-3 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter) or oil
1 large tomato, chopped
2 green chilies, slit
1/2 cup fresh coriander leaves, chopped
1/2 cup fresh mint leaves, chopped
A few strands of saffron soaked in 2 tablespoons warm milk (optional)
1 teaspoon biryani masala
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/2 cup fried onions (optional)
2 boiled eggs, halved (optional)
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 cup milk
Instructions:
Preparing the Rice:
Rinse the Basmati rice in cold water until the water runs clear.
In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaf, and salt.
Add the rinsed rice and cook until it is 70% cooked (the rice should still be firm). Drain and set aside.
Marinating the Chicken:
In a bowl, mix the yogurt, ginger paste, garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, and salt.
Add the chicken pieces and coat them well with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (overnight for best results).
Cooking the Chicken:
In a large pan, heat the ghee or oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and saut√© until golden brown.
Add the marinated chicken along with the marinade and cook until the chicken is almost cooked through and the oil starts to separate (about 15-20 minutes).
Add the chopped tomato, green chilies, half of the coriander leaves, and half of the mint leaves. Cook for another 5 minutes.
Layering and Cooking the Biryani:
In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, spread a layer of the partially cooked rice at the bottom.
Add a layer of the cooked chicken over the rice.
Repeat the layering process until all the rice and chicken are used up, finishing with a layer of rice on top.
Drizzle the saffron milk, biryani masala, lemon juice, and milk over the top layer.
Sprinkle the remaining coriander leaves, mint leaves, and fried onions.
Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid (you can seal it with dough to keep the steam in).
Cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to finish cooking (this process is called "dum").
Serving:
Once the biryani is done, gently fluff it with a fork to mix the layers.
Serve hot, garnished with boiled eggs and additional fried onions if desired.
